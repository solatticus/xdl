# Updating XDL Browser Extension

## Quick Update

Just run:
```batch
update-extension.bat
```

The script will:
1. Detect which browser you have
2. Open the extensions page
3. Tell you to click the Reload button

That's it! Your extension is updated.

## Manual Update

If the script doesn't work:

### Chrome
1. Open Chrome
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Find "XDL - Video Downloader"
4. Click the Reload button (↻)

### Edge
1. Open Edge
2. Go to `edge://extensions/`
3. Find "XDL - Video Downloader"
4. Click the Reload button (↻)

## When to Update

Update the extension when:
- You've made changes to the extension code
- You've pulled new changes from git
- The extension isn't working properly

## Troubleshooting

**Extension not showing up?**
- Make sure it's installed first (see main README)
- Check that Developer Mode is enabled

**Changes not taking effect?**
- Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5) after reloading
- Try restarting the browser completely
